   * **ICS20** tokens are tokens created following IBC ICS20 standards
   * https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/blob/main/spec/app/ics-020-fungible-token-transfer/README.md
   *
   * **ERC20** tokens are:
   * - Tokens from other chains that were transferred to Evmos via IBC
   *   These are usually automatically converted to ERC20 tokens on Evmos.
   * - Tokens native to evmos that were created via ERC20 contracts on EVM
   * - wEvmos, which is the EVM version of Evmos' native token
   *   Learn more about that here: https://academy.evmos.org/articles/advanced/automated-coin-conversion/
   *
   * The main pratical difference is that you interact (transfer, query balances, etc) with ICS20 tokens via the Cosmos SDK API
   * And in the case of evmos, through the ICS20 precompiled contract https://github.com/evmos/extensions/blob/main/precompiles/stateful/ICS20.sol
   *
   * While you interact with ERC20 tokens via the EVM API through their deployed contracts
